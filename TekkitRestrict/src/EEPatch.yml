# Set the maximum charge for a tool. (CaPSloCk Safe)
#
# Q: Why should I use this one over the one in ModModifications.config?
# A: Because this one directly blocks a player from charging. The one in the other config
#    uncharges a tool a level as soon as it finds one in someone's inventory that is
#    charged too high. Using this one over the one in ModModifications.config results in
#    a faster response and less server load.
#
# Default Charge Levels:
# 3 Charge Levels: DM tools
# 4 Charge Levels: RM tools, Destruction Catalyst, Hyperkinetic Lens, 
# 5 Charge Levels: Katar, Morning Star, Zero Ring, Ring of Ignition, Evertide Amulet
#                  Vulcanite Amulet, Philosopher's Stone, Watch of Flowing Time,
#                  Mercurial Eye
# 8 Charge Levels: Catalytic Lens
#
# NOTE: Charge Levels start at level 0. This means that:
# DM tools have Charge Levels 0, 1 and 2
# RM tools have Charge Levels 0, 1, 2 and 3
# Etc.
#
# Example:
# MaxCharge:
# - "RMPickaxe 1"   - Makes Red Matter Pickaxes charge to level 1 at max.
# - "RMTools 2"     - Makes all Red Matter Tools charge to level 2 at max. (This
#                     does NOT include Katar and Morning Star)
# - "ZeroRing 3"    - Makes the Zero Ring charge to level 3 at max.
# - "Rings 2"       - Makes the Zero Ring and the Ring of Ignition charge to level 2 max.

EEMaxCharge:
- "DMTools 2"
- "RMTools 3"
- "Katar 4"
- "MORNINGstar 4"
- "CatalyticLens 7"

###################################### Disable Actions #####################################
############################################################################################
# Here you can define what tool/ring/amulet actions you want to disable.
# Every value can either be true (allowed) or false (NOT allowed).
#
# Long version: 
# Keep in mind that with EEPatch, every action that changes a block checks if the player
# that does the action has permission in that location. This means that areas protected by
# GriefPrevention, WorldGuard, PreciousStones, Towns, Factions, LWC or any other protection
# plugin cannot be modified by these actions if the player does not have permission to break
# blocks at the location.
# For this reason, most actions that break blocks in a radius don't have to be blocked as
# they will already be blocked in protected areas. Only if you want to prevent 
# "nature grief" or just want to make the game harder you should disable these actions.
#
# Short version:
# EEPatch itself will make griefing with EE Tools impossible where it is not wanted, so you
# don't have to block most actions that break blocks in a radius, unless you don't want
# people to ever use these actions, not even where they are wanted.
#
# NOTE: If you change someone's permissions, it can take up to 60 seconds before the changes
# take effect.
#
# Default: true for all values
