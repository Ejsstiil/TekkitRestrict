################################# Limited Creative Configuration ##################################
###################################################################################################
# Limited creative is a function of TekkitRestrict where you can disallow items for players in
# creative mode. This way, you can give creative mode to people without having to worry about them
# making tons of Collectors, Solar panels, Red Matter Blocks and so on. You only have to set the
# items you don't want people to use in creative mode here, and TekkitRestrict will do the rest.
# 
# Limited creative will also prevent players in creative mode from dropping items on the ground.
# This makes sure they don't give items to players in survival mode.
# 
# Disable (false) or enable (true) Limited creative.
# Default: false
UseLimitedCreative: false
# 
# If you set this option to true, it will prevent the use of ANY container while a player is in
# creative mode. This means that he cannot place his creative diamond blocks in a chest and then
# use them in survival.
# If this is enabled, it prevents the use of ANY container while in creative mode. This is
# everything you can interact with, with the exception of your own inventory.
# Default: true
LimitedCreativeNoContainer: true
# 
# Here you can set the items you don't want creative players to use. You can enter mods, id's,
# item names, and more.
# Examples:
# - "EE {&cYou are not allowed to use Equivalent Exchange when you are in creative mode!}"
# - "1 {&cStone is banned for creative players!}"
# - "35:15 {&cWe just hate black wool, so don't build with it!}"
# - 50
# - "NetherGoldOre {&6Nether ores are explosive, so you are not allowed to build with them!}"
# 
# For a full list of mods, usable item names and more examples, see Info.yml
