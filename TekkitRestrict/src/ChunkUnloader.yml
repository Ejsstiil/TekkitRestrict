########################################## ChunkUnloader ##########################################
###################################################################################################
# WARNING: On LARGE servers, chunk unloaders are known to cause problems that make the server
# CRASH! This will happen with an error about tile entities. If you see this error, you may want
# to consider turning the chunk unloader OFF!
# 
# NOTE: If you are using MCPCSpout, you will not have this problem, and you can leave the Chunk
# Unloader OFF.
# 
# This will be very useful for preventing your server from getting over 30,000 chunks.
# 
# There is a bug with the Normal Tekkit server in which the server gains "Trash" in the memory
# from disposing of chunks. I recommend keeping your MaxChunks around 3000-4000 to prevent this
# from disabling your server over time.
# 
# If you lower it below 1000, you have a chance of lagging your server by player movements.
UseChunkUnloader: true
# 
# The maximal amount of chunks loaded at a time. If this amount is exceeded, chunks will be
# forcefully unloaded (even if they have chunk loaders) to clear RAM.
# The more players you have on the server, the higher you should set this to.
# 
# Max number of chunks for the End.
# Recommended: 100-400 (the End is usually not a often visited place)
# Default: 200
MaxChunks TheEnd: 200
# 
# Max number of chunks for the Nether.
# Recommended: 300-600 (depends on how many players live in the Nether)
# Default: 400
MaxChunks Nether: 400
# 
# Max number of chunks for normal type worlds.
# Recommended: (Server RAM in GB)*700 to (Server RAM in GB)*900
# Default: 4000
MaxChunks Normal: 4000
# 
# Max number of chunks loaded in total (all worlds)
# If this number is exceeded, the UnloadOrder will come in effect.
# Recommended: (Server RAM in GB)*700 to (Server RAM in GB)*900
# Default: 4000
MaxChunks Total: 4000
# 
# UnloadOrder
# The order in which chunks from worlds will be unloaded when the total number of chunks is
# exceeded.
# 0 - The End, Nether, Normal worlds    (default)
# 1 - Nether, The End, Normal worlds
# 
# 2 - Normal worlds, The End, Nether    (not recommended)
# 3 - The End, Normal worlds, Nether    (not recommended)
# 
# 4 - Nether, Normal worlds, The End    (not recommended)
# 5 - Normal worlds, Nether, The End    (not recommended)
# 
# 2 and 3 are not recommended unless your main world is a Nether world.
# 4 and 5 are not recommended unless your main world is an End world.
# 
# It is recommended to put the least used world first.
UnloadOrder: 0
# 
# The radius of blocks that should stay loaded around a player.
# The ChunkUnloader will not unload chunks that are within this radius to a player.
# Minecraft's default is 256 blocks (16 chunks).
# 
# Recommended: 128-256
# Default: 256
MaxRadii: 256
